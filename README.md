## credit
This project is a derivative work of [afetch](https://github.com/jack-davidson/afetch-suckless). I created this project because
I wanted to modify the code style (no stdbool, no c++ comments) and wanted
to port to c89. The modifications done on afetch are minimal and could be
merged as a patch. The maintainers of afetch have decided their own code
style so for a project configured through source, I thought this style
is superior.
